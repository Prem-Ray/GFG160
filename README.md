# GeeksforGeeks 160 Solutions in C++

This repository contains my solutions to 160 problems from GeeksforGeeks, implemented exclusively in C++. The solutions are designed for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best coding practices.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
GFG160/
│
├── Arrays/
│   ├── Problem1.cpp
│   ├── Problem2.cpp
│   └── ...
│
├── Strings/
│   ├── Problem3.cpp
│   ├── Problem4.cpp
│   └── ...
│
├── Dynamic_Programming/
│   ├── Problem5.cpp
│   ├── Problem6.cpp
│   └── ...
│
└── README.md
```

- Each folder corresponds to a specific topic, such as Arrays, Strings, or Dynamic Programming.
- Files are named based on the problem's title or description.

## Prerequisites

To run these solutions, you will need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, CLion, or Code::Blocks)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gfg160.git
